                <h3>Beyond Boundaries: Pioneering Thingworx Excellence in MES, PLM, and IIoT 4.0.</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 24px;">I am Shashi Preetham, a beacon in the world of digital transformation with a specialized focus on PTC
                    Thingworx, Kepserver EX, and Tulip.co, Windchill-PTC Thingworx Integration, and Microsoft Azure. My
                    vast experience stretches across Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), Manufacturing Execution Systems
                    (MES), and the advanced realms of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) 4.0.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 24px;">Having championed numerous projects, I've sculpted seamless integrations, particularly highlighting
                    the symbiotic relationship between Windchill and Thingworx. The digital manufacturing platform of
                    Tulip.co has been another canvas where I've painted innovative solutions, ensuring real-time
                    insights and operational excellence for businesses.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 24px;">My expertise isn't restricted to theory; it's been battle-tested and validated in the trenches of
                    contracting, consultancy, and freelancing. At the crossroads of these domains, I've intricately
                    interwoven Thingworx's capabilities with the robustness of Kepserver EX and the unmatched
                    scalability of Azure. As I navigate this landscape, I don't just understand or utilize these
                    platforms; I push their boundaries to craft bespoke solutions for the ever-evolving challenges of
                    the digital age.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 24px;">Being a seasoned contractor, insightful consultant, and agile freelancer, my vision isn't limited to
                    adapting to the digital evolution – I aim to spearhead it. As we stand at the threshold of a digital
                    renaissance, I invite you to partner with me. Together, we'll not only navigate the future of
                    digital innovation but also shape it.</p>
